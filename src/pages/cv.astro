    Iâ€™m a curious methodology and statistics student with eclectic interests. 
    In my studies, I am critically minded, ready to admit my own mistakes, and hard-working. 
    I have no problems with being a beginner in something, and I embrace the challenges 
    and learning opportunities that come with that.

I am currently specializing in machine learning and front-end development! I am also working on my thesis, in which I model ordinal estimates of quantitative measures in time-dependent processes.

      ASReview is a system that uses machine learning to help select relevant papers for literature reviews. I am currently comparing various ways of calculating inter-rater reliability. Several raters can rate scientific papers as either relevant or irrelevant. I look to which degree these different raters coincide, and how we can calculate this degree in the best way.
